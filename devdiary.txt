Started a local GIT repository for the project. Almost nothing works right
now, because I organized the files to subdirectories. I'm at loss on what the
directory layout should look like for a project like this. Here's why:

- Can't split by file type, because both the server and client are built in JS
- Can't split (cleanly) by client/server, because they share a lot of code
- And finally, there might be multiple games that will share an engine

Oh well, I guess I'll figure it out eventually.
