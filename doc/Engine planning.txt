ENGINE PLANNING
===============

This document contains the current plan regarding how the engine should work.

----------
Game setup
----------

Sample communication of how the game should start:

# The client establishes a WebSocket connection to the game server with the
# following parameters:
# - player: The identification code of the player
# - game: The identification code of the game
# - random: A random string to make the data unguessable
# - mac: Message authentication code that proves who the user is

# The server responds with a server hello

SERVER> A{"$": "hello"}

# The client tells the server that the client is ready to receive the initial game
# state. From the server's perspective initial game state is not much different from
# backlogged messages.

CLIENT> A{"$": "ack", "tag": 0}

# The server tells the client which map to use

SERVER> A{"$": "loadMap", "src": "http://localhost:8000/fs/maps/map.js"}

# The server tells the client who the players are

SERVER> A{"$": "AC", "$type": "Commander", "id": 1, "playerId": "tim", "color": "#ff0000"}
SERVER> A{"$": "AC", "$type": "Commander", "id": 2, "playerId": "tom", "color": "#0000ff"}
SERVER> A{"$": "youAre", "id": 1}

# The client tells the server that it has loaded the map

CLIENT> A{"$": "mapDone"}

# The server starts the game

SERVER> A{"$": "gameStart"}

# The server notifies that a tick has completed from its point of view

SERVER> A{"$": "TC", "tick": 0}

# The client notifies that it wishes to send a command

CLIENT> B{"$": "construct", "what": "PowerPlant"}

# The server echoes the command back to all clients

SERVER> B,tim,{"$": "construct", "what": "PowerPlant"}

# The server notifies again that a tick has completed

SERVER> A{"$": "TC", "tick": 1}
